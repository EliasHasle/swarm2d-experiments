<h1>Swarm experiments</h1>
<p>Here is a small collection of experiments that I made in a Swarm Intelligence course in Ã…lesund.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="Behavior_Arrival.html">Arrival behavior</a></li>
	<li><a href="Behavior_Seek_comparison.html">Two different Seek behavior implementations</a> The red one is smarter. Refresh the page multiple times to get new random scenarios.</li>
	<li><a href="Pack_hunting_Non-PID.html">Pack hunting with single target per hunter and optimized pursue implementation</a> - Suffers a bit from conflicts due to the (necessary) separation behavior.</li>
	<li><a href="Pack_hunting_experimental_PID_averaged_target_online-optimization.html">Experimental pack hunting using combined behaviors, weighted target points, PID controllers and online optimization</a> - It suffers a bit from PID being more suited for docking than pursuing.</li>
	<li><a href="PSO_Visual_with_sliders.html">Simple PSO searching in a 2D plane</a>, with interactive modification of PSO parameters</li>
	<li><a href="PSO_Visual_with_parameters_oscillating_in_dissonance.html">PSO dissonance</a> - Experiment with PSO parameters swiping over their range at frequencies related by the golden ratio, and respawning particles upon convergence to global best known</li>
	<li><a href="PSO_Path.html">PSO_Path</a> - A simplistic short-sighted path planning using PSO, with interactive controls</li>
	<li><a href="PSO_Path_optimized.html">PSO_Path_optimized</<> - A variant of the above that uses the last PSO state in previous position as starting point in the new position and runs only a single iteration per decision, compensating with a more particles and larger space (still only selects a direction without building a search tree)</li>
</ul>
